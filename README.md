# GRAVIS VIDEO GAME PROJECT
This was a university project for the course "Computerspiele & Viusal Effects".

If you want to try this game you can clone the repository.
After that you can launch it in the Unreal Engine 4 Editor and launch the `MainEntryLevel`.

Note that you might have to build the rooms first to improve the performance.
